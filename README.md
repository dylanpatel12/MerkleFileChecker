# MerkleFileChecker
File Integrity Checker using Merkle Trees for fast and secure verification of file changes.


This Python project implements a File Integrity Checker using Merkle Trees. It scans a folder of files, computes hashes for each file, and builds a Merkle Tree to generate a single root hash representing the entire directory. Later, the root hash can be used to quickly verify if any file has been modified, and optionally, identify which specific file changed.

The project demonstrates practical applications of data structures and hashing, combining efficiency with security. Perfect for learning about Merkle Trees, cryptographic hashing, and file integrity verification.
